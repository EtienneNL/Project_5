# Welcome to data folder of this project!

The folder contains:

1. MyFitbitData: it consists of 2 main folders with raw data from fitbit device, Physical activities and sleep data. The raw data is posted here because in the code file (in code folder) there are codes meant for combining these raw data from scratch.

2. An PNG image, illustrating a feature of Ridge regression model.
